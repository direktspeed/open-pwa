# OPEN-PWA
An OpenSource Project to research and offer the ability to Port PWA Concepts to any Platform by providing the needed API's to legacy Platforms

## What and Why?
We will research and create an environment agnostic way to run PWA's in browsers that do not support them. we will offer a permission-based API and implement all the functionality that chrome offers for a PWA.

so this will be a single daemon or app or server it is not so important how we name that. It will expose API's that a remote website can call to request a local installation and use of existing Platform features.

The Implementation will be written in JS the First Prototype will be NodeJs based and later we expand it to GraalJs to get it even more embedded able while keeping the code understandable by all ECMAScript knowing people,


This is an Open Source Effort it got initialized by Frank Lemanschik not on purpose because he has written that article
